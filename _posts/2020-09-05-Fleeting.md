Dear Friend,
   
It is all fleeting. The moment seems to last long, but the past seems compressed, broken, long gone. Almost as if it wasn't.
   
You're so caught up in the moment, as if it's the only second / minute / hour / day that counts. Maybe it does. Maybe it doesn't.
Time isn't meant to be obsessed about. It's to be lived through, right? Enjoyed, regretted, experienced. But it's all fleeting.   
   
Don't count your moments. Count nothing. Don't attempt to quantify your life and all you lived through. Language, Math help you
grasp those moments better, but they reduce them all the same. Ramble on just like I do in this letter. It's okay to not make
sense and to flow with how you feel. Rationality is overrated.   
   
Be true to that moment, but let that truth be fleeting as well. Just be. Being is worth it. People are worth it.   
   
Yours,
Wallflower.
