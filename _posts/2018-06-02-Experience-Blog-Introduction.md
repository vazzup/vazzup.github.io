<p style="text-align: justify;">
For a majority of <s>Indian</s> teens, the 11th and 12th grades are a struggle. We are going through the mess that is
puberty, are preparing blindly for competitive exams like JEE, CET, NEET, NAT, CPT, etc., and are overall in a really
bad place. But that's not the worst part; the worst part is when you get through it all just barely and ask yourself
the question - "What next?" You get into a mediocre engineering / medical / architecture college or just barely scrape
through to IPCC but have no clue what to do next. The various opportunities and possibilities scare you because you've
never really had so many choices of such grave importance.<br><br>
Today was my last day (hopefully) at an engineering college. I was mildly successful in a few ventures, and wildly
unsuccesful in many others. It's been a rollercoaster of a journey. How did I survive? To paraphrase the definition
of dynamic programming, "Those who can't remember the past are doomed to repeat it." I took the help, the advice,
the wins, and the losses of my seniors and from them built a sort of model to survive these 4 years.<br><br>
In the posts of this series, I will be describing my experiences with engineering - computer science to be precise. To
make things clear, I won't be giving advice or teachings like a wise old sage. I am not one. However, I will be writing
down all that went through my head in each experience, how I dealt with it and the results of each choice. These posts
will be written and published in the upcoming days in the hope that some day some junior - whether starting with
engineering, or midway through it - figures out his own solutions based on mine.<br><br>
P.S. Please don't judge me.
