I am in the prime of my life. Literally, and mathematically. 24 can be represented as 2 * 2 * 2 * 3, all primes. Though
this is a bit of a cheat. All numbers can be represented as a product of primes. So I can confidently claim that,
mathematically, I am always in my prime.   
   
This might seem trivial, but what isn't? If you take a view distant enough, and large enough, most anything can feel
trivial. From the perspective of the time mammals have been around, modern human existence is trivially small, from
the perspective of the time since the first cellular life emerged, the significance of mammals seems miniscule, and
so on. Perspective makes a big difference.

But what fun is it to have a perspective that marks everything trivial? Sure, it allows you to remain stoic about shit
because "hey, what does it matter anyway?" This sort of Nihilism leads to nothing. Like Camus, I decide to rebel against
this defeatism of triviality. If I say it is not trivial, then it is not. If that is what I need to feel alive, so be it.   
   
And so, I claim, nay, declare - my life has not been trivial; is not trivial; and will never be trivial. I am grateful for
all I have been through and experienced. I am hopeful for what is to come. I wish this unto others too - may no one ever
feel trivial to the world. Every single person matters. Especially now, when the world goes through so much. How do I know?
Glad you asked.   
   
1 is not a prime number. 1 Second is a trivial amount of time. Add 31,536,000 seconds though, and you get a year. Add that
to my life, voila, I've aged to my next prime time. And so it is that the "trivial" non primes add up to me being in my
prime always. Here's to turning another trivial moment into an amazing year.
