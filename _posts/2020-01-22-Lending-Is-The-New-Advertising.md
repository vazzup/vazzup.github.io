In the late 00’s, as the internet age matured in developed countries, advertising became the sexy way to monetise. The
strategy for most consumer internet startups was simple - Make it free, get a huge audience (i.e. distribution), and 
then leverage it for distributing advertisements.   

Late 10’s onwards, in developing economies like India, advertising isn’t worth as much - but lending is. In a cash
strapped economy, startups like [Khatabook](https://khatabook.com/), and [BharatPe](https://bharatpe.com/) are building
huge distribution networks. All of them will look to monetise the same through microlending.   

Back then, everybody could advertise - Today, everybody can lend. We will see consolidations and cornering of market by
a few players. It’s anybody’s guess who the lenders with the best distribution channel will be. My guess is
[PayTM](http://paytm.com).   

I foresee that eventually just like in ads, lenders will enable smaller individuals to create distribution for them. I’m
interested in learning - who’s creating the AdSense Network for Lending?
