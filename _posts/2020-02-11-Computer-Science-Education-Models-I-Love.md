India is rapidly de-industrializing. The next wave of jobs will have to come from the IT and Tech Industry. I believe India can build a middle class, and a robust economy, with the backbone of software. Software education in India is changing, and I believe good educational models can help expedite this movement. Some I particularly like

## ISA BootCamps
Coding Bootcamps like [Lambda School](http://lambdaschool.com) / [Pesto Tech](http://pesto.tech) help participants
become employable and get good jobs with no upfront costs. They sign an Income Share Agreement which says that if youâ€™re
placed after the bootcamp, they get a share of your income for a limited time. This model has a lower monetary barrier
of entry as compared to proper uni degrees.

## Corporate Sponsored Education
[Shopify](http://shopify.com) has partnered with a university to provide free education and paid work experience to
students. You heard it right. You get your undergrad degree in CS, with just one year of uni education, and 3 years of
real life work. Check [devdegree.ca](http://devdegree.ca)

This is a model I think more enterprises should pursue. Universities should focus on educating those who want to move
into academia. Enterprises should focus on educating those who want to work in applied fields.

## [Ecole42](www.42.fr)
A very unique non profit model that sponsors your stay and food for the period. The learning is in a low / semi - 
structured environment. You have to be an autodidact to learn, through the internet, your own projects, and collaborate
with a few mentors / peers.
