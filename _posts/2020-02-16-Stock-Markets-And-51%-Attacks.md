Stock Market Slumps are basically 51% attacks on the public markets. 

In the BitCoin Blockchain, any decision about the network can be put in effect as long as 51% or more of the computing power is behind the decision. 

Stock Markets work similarly. When 51% of the money invested in the markets think it's a bull market, the market will grow. When a majority turns bearish, the market as a whole slumps.

Currently in India, despite the slowdown, the unemployment, the internal turmoil, the markets have been growing and reaching new highs. This only tells me that a majority of India still believes in the India story.

I believe in the India story. Despite whatever the short term signals say about the country's economy, we will find a way. We always have. I am long India.
