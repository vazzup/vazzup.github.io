# What's all this then?
Hello and welcome to my personal website and blog! I am a computer science graduate from KJSCE with a varied set of
skills. It is my firm belief that magic happens at the intersection of multiple disciplines. I am always looking for
opportunities to augment other fields using my knowledge of in CS. Some fields I'm interested in:
* Robotics
* BioMedical Devices
* Machine Learning and Deep Learning
* FinTech
* Blockchain

Here's my [complete resume](./Resume/VatsalKanakiya.pdf).

# Skillset
* I am skilled in the general purpose programming languages C / C++, Java, Python3 and C#.
* I have 4 years of experience working on linux systems (Ubuntu, Arch Linux) using tools like git, vim, zsh, etc and am
a terminal power user.
* I have experience using machine learning and deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn.
* I have used Linear Algebra libraries like numpy, eigen, boostcpp and languages like MATLAB.

# Assorted Projects
## RoboRehab
RoboRehab is a Continuous Passive Motion Machine used to rehabilitate patients who have lost control over their arm due
to stroke or paralysis. I worked upon the app, the server and the embedded c control code for this project. This project
will be presented at the Smart India Hackathon 2018.

## Pediatric Perimeter
The Pediatric Perimieter is a first of its kind device to measure the visual field of infants in order to detect and
diagnose diseases like glaucoma in the early stages. I worked upon the GUI, the arduino code and the design of the device
while an intern at the L. V. Prasad Center for innovation.

## VZ_Learn
A library of machine learning and data preprocessing algorithms written in C++ using the boost uBLAS library.

# Publications
* Automated Gait Generation for Simulated Bodies using Deep Reinforcement Learning
This paper was published at the ICICCT 2018 conference and is part of its proceedings. It will also be published in
IEEE Explore.
