<p style="text-align: justify; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">
Hello and welcome to my personal website and blog! I am a computer science graduate from KJSCE with a varied set of
skills. It is my firm belief that magic happens at the intersection of multiple disciplines. I am always looking for
opportunities to augment other fields using my knowledge of in CS. Some fields I'm interested in:
</p>
* Robotics
* Biomedical Devices
* Machine Learning and Deep Learning
* FinTech
* Blockchain

Here's my [complete resume](./Resume/VatsalKanakiya.pdf){:target="_blank"}.

# Work Experience

## Morgan Stanley
**_Summer Technology Intern at Mumbai, India (May 2017 - July 2017)_**   
<p style="text-align: justify;">
I worked on an internal visualisation and manipulation tool for financial data written in C# at the Prime Brokerage,
Funding and Finance Technology Department. I designed and implemented a unique algorithm to store and retrieve
hierarchical data to and from a relational database in a paginated fashion which led to a drastic improvement in the
performance of the application under huge stress.
</p>
## L. V. Prasad Center for Innovation
_**Summer Research Fellow at Hyderabad, India (May 2016 - July 2016)   
Project Mentor at Engineering the Eye Hackathon (July 2016)**_
<p style="text-align: justify;">
I worked on Pediatric Perimeter, a first of its kind device that measures the visual fields of infants to detect defects
and help provide early stage medical aid.  I worked on the GUI and wrote arduino code. I designed and implemented a
unique communication protocol for tranmission of data between the GUI and the arduino that also checked for transmission
errors and redundancy.

# Assorted Projects
---
## RoboRehab
<p style="text-align: justify; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">
RoboRehab is a Continuous Passive Motion Machine used to rehabilitate patients afflicted by stroke or paralysis by
helping them regain control over their arm movements. I designed and developed the mobile application and server for
the  device and contributed to the embedded C code. The project has been shortlisted for Smart India Hackathon 2018
finalsI worked upon the app, the server and the embedded c control code for this project. This project
will be presented at the Smart India Hackathon 2018.</p>

## VZ_Learn
<p style="text-align: justify; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">
A library of machine learning and data preprocessing algorithms written from scratch in C++ using the boost uBLAS library.
Algorithms implemented gradient descent, decision tree (ID3), naive bayes, feature normalization, feature discretization, etc.

Apart from my academic side, I'm a huge literature, music and movie buff. On the big screen, I love the works of Woody
Allen, Quentin Tarantino, Cristopher Nolan and Wes Anderson. I particularly love the works of Wes Anderson, not least
due to the color and symmetry in his work. In literature I have a long list of fiction and non fiction writers I adore.
One I must mention here is Douglas Adams for his philosophical satire "The HitchHiker's Guide to the galaxy." I aspire
to write poems as raw as Robert Frost's.  Lastly, in the music department, I wonder at the genius that are the artists
Pink Floyd, Radiohead, Nirvana, Steven Wilson, A. R. Rahman, Miles Davis, Dave Brubeck, Chopin and Debussy to name a few.
