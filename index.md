# What's all this then?

I write about my personal experiences in the venture capital world, Web3, Emerging Techologies,
past experiences from engineering school, movies, books, art, economics, finance, and in general anything
and everything I find interesting.

I am currently the Principal and CTO of [100X.VC](https://100x.vc), a new India focused venture fund looking to be the
launching pad for the next 500 moonshots coming out of India. I'm also Web3 Investor at [2AM VC](www.2amvc.com) and
partner at my Family Office [Mehta Ventures](https://mehtaventures.co)

Pitch to 100X.VC at [100x.vc/class08](https://100x.vc/class08). Want to talk to me
about something? Write to me at [vatsal@100x.vc](mailto:vatsal@100x.vc)

Apart from my work, I'm a huge literature, music and movie buff. On the big screen, I love the works of Woody
Allen, Quentin Tarantino, Cristopher Nolan and Wes Anderson. I particularly love the works of Wes Anderson, not least
due to the color and symmetry in his work. In literature I have a long list of fiction and non fiction writers I adore.
One I must mention here is Douglas Adams for his philosophical satire "The HitchHiker's Guide to the galaxy." I aspire
to write poems as raw as Robert Frost's.  Lastly, in the music department, I wonder at the genius that are the artists
Pink Floyd, Radiohead, Nirvana, Steven Wilson, A. R. Rahman, Miles Davis, Dave Brubeck, Chopin and Debussy to name a few. -->
