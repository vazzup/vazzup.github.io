# What's all this then?
Hello and welcome to my personal website and blog! I am a computer science graduate from KJSCE with a varied set of
skills. It is my firm belief that magic happens at the intersection of multiple disciplines. I am always looking for
opportunities to augment other fields using my knowledge of in CS. Some fields I'm interested in:
* Robotics
* BioMedical Devices
* Machine Learning and Deep Learning
* FinTech
* Blockchain

Here's my [complete resume](./Resume/VatsalKanakiya.pdf).

# Skillset
I am skilled in the general purpose programming languages C / C++, Java, Python3 and C#. I have 4 years of experience
working on linux systems (Ubuntu, Arch Linux) using tools like git, vim, zsh, etc. I am a terminal power user. I have
experience using machine learning and deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn. I am also
skilled with implementing machine learning algorithms using Linear Algebra libraries like numpy, eigen, boostcpp or in
languages like MATLAB.
