    <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
    <p>Hello! As the title says, I am <em>Vatsal Kanakiya</em>. I am a curious 
        Computer Engineer. <strong>I believe the field of computer science is meant
        to work in tandem with others</strong>. I am looking for opportunities to augment other fields with my skills.
    </p>
    <h3>Fields I'm interested in:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Blockchain</li>
        <li>Machine Learning and Deep Learning</li>
        <li>Robotics</li>
        <li>Healthcare</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Let it breathe</h2>
    <p>Look at lines 1 and 2 of some shitty website you're building. Assuming they're not married they probably shouldn't be
        humping. The defaults are trash -- pick a minimum <code>line-height: 1.4</code> for body copy. Headings should be
        tighter. If you can't see that...piss off.</p>
    <p>If your text hits the side of the browser, fuck off forever. You ever see a book like that? Yes? What a shitty book.</p>
    <h2>A little less contrast</h2>
    <p>Black on white? How often do you see that kind of contrast in real life? Tone it down a bit, asshole. I would've even
        made this site's background a nice <code>#EEEEEE</code> if I wasn't so focused on keeping declarations to a lean
        7 fucking lines.</p>
    <h2>Size Matters</h2>
    <p>I know your partner says otherwise, but it's true. Bump that body copy to render close to 16px or more. Smaller type
        works well for print, not the screen.</p>
    <h2>Line-width, motherfucker</h2>
    <p>Looking at an LCD screen is strainful enough. Don't make me read a line of text that's 200 fucking characters long. Keep
        it to a nice 60-80 and users might actually read more than one sentence of your worthless dribble.</p>
    <h3>Yes, this is <em>also</em> fucking satire, you fuck</h3>
    <p>I love what the creator of <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">this site's inspiration</a> did. What I'm saying
        is that it's so, so simple to make sites easier to read. Websites are broken by default, they are functional, high-performing,
        and accessible, but they're also fucking ugly. You and all the other web designers out there need to make them not
        total shit.</p>
