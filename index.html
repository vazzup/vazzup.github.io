    <h1>Who Am I?</h1>
	<p align="justify">
		Hello! As the title says, I am <span style="font-size:1.25em;"><strong>Vatsal
		Kanakiya</strong></span>, a computer science student at K. J. Somaiya College
		of Engineering, Mumbai. I am curious and an auto didact. I believe true magic
		happens at the confluence of multiple fields. I am looking for opportunities
		to expand my knowledge, contribute to varied fields, and make a difference.
    </p>
    <h3>Fields I'm interested in:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Blockchain</li>
        <li>Machine Learning and Deep Learning</li>
        <li>Robotics</li>
        <li>Healthcare</li>
		<li>Financial Engineering</li>
    </ul>

	<h1>More About Me</h1>
	<p align="justify">
		Apart from my academic side, I'm a huge literature, music and movie buff.
		On the big screen, I love the works of Woody Allen, Quentin Tarantino, 
		Cristopher Nolan and Wes Anderson. I particularly love the works of Wes
		Anderson, not least due to the color and symmetry in his work. In literature
		I have a long list of fiction and non fiction writers I adore. One I must 
		mention here is Douglas Adams for his philosophical satire "The HitchHiker's
		Guide to the galaxy." I also aspire to write poems as raw as Robert Frost's.
		Lastly, in the music department, I wonder at the genius that is in the 
		artists Pink Floyd, Radiohead, Nirvana, Steven Wilson, A. R. Rahman, 
		Miles Davis, Dave Brubeck, Chopin and Debussy to name a few.
