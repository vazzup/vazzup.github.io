    <h1>Who Am I?</h1>
	<p align="justify">
		Hello! I am <span style="font-size:1.25em;"><strong>Vatsal
		Kanakiya</strong></span>, a computer science student at K. J. Somaiya College
		of Engineering, Mumbai. I am naturally curious and an auto didact. I believe true magic
		happens at the confluence of multiple fields. I am looking for opportunities
		to expand my knowledge, contribute to varied fields, and make a difference.
		Here's my <a href="./Resume/VatsalKanakiya.pdf" target="_blank">Resume</a>.
    </p>
    <h3>Fields I'm interested in:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Blockchain</li>
        <li>Machine Learning and Deep Learning</li>
        <li>Robotics</li>
        <li>Healthcare</li>
		<li>Financial Engineering</li>
    </ul>

	<h1>More About Me</h1>
	<blockquote style="padding-bottom:0.5em;">
		<p>"... medicine, law, business, engineering, these are noble pursuits 
		and necessary to sustain life. But poetry, beauty, romance, love, these 
		are what we stay alive for." <br>

	<p align="justify">
		Apart from my academic side, I'm a huge literature, music and movie buff.
		On the big screen, I love the works of Woody Allen, Quentin Tarantino, 
		Cristopher Nolan and Wes Anderson. I particularly love the works of Wes
		Anderson, not least due to the color and symmetry in his work. In literature
		I have a long list of fiction and non fiction writers I adore. One I must 
		mention here is Douglas Adams for his philosophical satire "The HitchHiker's
		Guide to the galaxy." I aspire to write poems as raw as Robert Frost's.
		Lastly, in the music department, I wonder at the genius that is in the 
		artists Pink Floyd, Radiohead, Nirvana, Steven Wilson, A. R. Rahman, 
		Miles Davis, Dave Brubeck, Chopin and Debussy to name a few.

		<em>Summer Technology Analyst 
			<span style="float:right;">May 2017 - July 2017</span>
		</em>
	</span>
	<p style="text-align:justify; ">
		As a Summer Technology Analyst at Morgan Stanley I got to work on a C# 
		application to view, update, delete, filter, sort, and group financial 
		data. I implemented a unique solution to store to and retrieve
		hierarchical data from a relational database in a paginated fashion.

	<h2>Srujana Center for Innovation, LVPEI, India</h2>
	<span style="font-size:0.9em">
		<em>Summer Research Fellow
			<span style="float:right;">May 2016 - July 2016</span>
		</em>
	</span>
	<p style="text-align:justify; ">
		At the Srujana Center for Innovation, I was tasked with improving, 
		optimising and calibrating the hardware and software of the
		Pediaric Perimeter. I was also a mentor at the Engineering the Eye
		Hackathon where my team and I worked on implementing various 
		Machine Learning and Image Processing Algorithms for Gaze Tracking.
